<h1>Sarcasm Detection Based on Textual Data</h1>
I do this project in order to complete my natural language processing course. I build BERT, RoBERTa, GRU-LSTM and other machine learning model. I do data preprocessing for all the model built. My aim in this project is to compare which machine learning or deep learning model has the best accuracy for identifying sarcasm based on textual data. <br>
